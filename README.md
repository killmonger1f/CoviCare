# CoviCare

CoviCare is a web app that helps people share the availability of beds and oxygen cylinders in hospitals.
It is built using Flutter SDK and uses Firebase for authentication and Cloud Firestore as backend. It is coded using Dart language.
Once the user is authenticated, they can add details about the hospital and person to contact where beds or oxygen cylinders are available.

A video of the interface and working of the app has been attached below.
